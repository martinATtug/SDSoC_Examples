SDSoC Example Repository 
===========================

Welcome to the SDSoC example repository. This repository contains the latest examples to get you started with application optimization targeting Xilinx Embedded FPGA acceleration boards. All the examples are ready to be compiled and executed on boards. These examples are developed in C/C++ flow. The "cpp" directory of this repository contains SDSoC examples in C/C++ form.

This repository is organized as follows internally.

1. CPP
2. OCL 
3. LIBS
4. UTILITY
5. OTHER INFORMATION
6. SUPPORT
7. REVISION HISTORY


### 1. CPP

Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use
different features of SDSoC (C/C++) and start on their own application. 

### 2. OCL

Collection of examples geared at teaching the user best practices in how to use 
different features of OpenCL and start on their own application for 
OpenCL Unified Platform.

### 3. LIBS

Collection of common libraries used across all examples to assist in the quick
development of source code which is not targeted to programmable logic (PL).

### 4. UTILITY

Collection of utility functions used as part of the Makefiles in all of the
examples. This set includes Makefile rules and scripts to launch SDSoC compiled
applications onto SDSoC emulation flow. It also contains Makefile and Readme
generation scripts.
